TODO:
    -> i2c MASTER
        - better testbench for i2c master 
        - add input/output buffers to i2c master 


__7/2__

Need to make an i2c master IP.
    - I could get one from openCores.
    - Or I could make my own. 
    - Or pay for Xilinx IP. 
    
For a custom i2c master IP I would need:
    - input and output buffers
    - i2c master write functionality
    - i2c master read functionality
    - glue logic between i2c master and buffers
    - AXI slave interface
    - custom drivers 

Xilinx IP:
    Pros: 
        - almost guaranteed to work 
        - will come with drivers 
    Cons: 
        - have to pay 

Custom IP:
    Pros: 
        - learning experience 
    Cons:
        - take a lot of time 
        - reliability not guaranteed (depends on time investment)

Open Source IP:
    Pros:
        - high likelihood it will work 
    Cons:
        - may have to write own drivers 

I will source an open-source IP. Maybe I will make my own IP in the future, but for 
now the goal of this project is to focus on the Embedded software aspect and learn 
to use VDMA.
