I need to make a module that can capture video data from the 
OV7670 camera and feed into an AXI Stream Data FIFO.

The module shall have the following functionality:
    1) Support 640x480 30FPS RGB565 video capture.
    2) Support 640x480 30FPS RGB888 video output.
        2a) Video output shall be via AXI Stream interface. 
    3) Allow user control via AXI Slave interface.
        3a) User shall be able to enable/disable capture.


==================== INTERFACE SPEC ======================

->> SYSTEM
    i_sysclk
        - system clock 
    i_resetn
        - asynchronous active-low reset 

->> CONTROL  
    i_en 
        - on assert:
            - start video capture at SoF 
        - on deassert:
            - if frame in progress: end capture at EoF
            - if not in progress:   stop all capture 

->> AXI4 STREAM OUTPUT 

SIGNAL NAME          | DIR | WIDTH | DESCRIPTION
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
m_axis_video_tdata   | OUT |  24   | output video data (RGB888) pixel 
m_axis_tvalid        | OUT |  1    | output valid 
m_axis_video_tready  | IN  |  1    | output ready

m_axis_video_tuser   | OUT |  1    | output video data SoF; first pixel of frame  
m_axis_video_tlast   | OUT |  1    | output video data EoL; last pixel of line 

Video Data: 
-> m_axis_video_tdata:
    [23:16 ] [ 15:8 ] [ 7:0 ]
       R        B        G       

Start of Frame: 
-> m_axis_tuser:
    - 1 transaction wide pulse 
    - must coincide with first pixel of frame 
    - may be asserted before video data as long as there is no valid

End of Line:
-> m_axis_video_tlast:
    - 1 transaction wide pulse 
    - must coincide with last pixel of a scanline 

Rules:
    1) VALID must be cleared following any reset.
    2) Nothing happens unless VALID && READY.
    3) Something ALWAYS happens when VALID && READY.
    4) Nothing can change unless !VALID or READY. 
    5) There must be no combinatorial paths between input and output signals.
